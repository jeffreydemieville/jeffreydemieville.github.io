excerpt: "Using Controlled Atmosphere to Reduce Post-Harvest Losses - Mitigating Impact of the Larger Grain Borer in East Africa.
<br>Received Senior Capstone Design Second Place Award - Biological and Agricultural Engineering with co-authors Ezekiel McReynolds, Kevin Jerpseth, and Brandon Flores. 
<br>A prototype storage unit was created and outfitted with sensors to measure carbon dioxide, oxygen, and temperature. The design was able to successfully develop an atmosphere which would induce dormancy in the larger grain borer.
