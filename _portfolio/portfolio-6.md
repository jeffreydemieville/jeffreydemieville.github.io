title: "University of Arizona Field Scanalyzer - 2019"
excerpt: "Undertook a project to rewrite the operating scripts on the Maricopa Field Scanner Sensing Platform, refactoring and optimizing the codebase. This reduced the number of scripts used in the season from 107 in the 2018-2019 winter season to 92 in the 2019 summer season, and then further to only 2 actively-used and 7 special-purpose scripts in the 2019-2020 winter season. Iterative development led to parameter-driven operation of the field scanner system and automation of significant portions of the work.<br>University of Arizona, Maricopa, Arizona, USA<br/><img src='/images/2019Script_Rewrite.PNG'>"
