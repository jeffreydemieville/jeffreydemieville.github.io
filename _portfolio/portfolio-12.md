title: "University of Arizona Field Scanalyzer - 2021"
excerpt: "Based on a published design (Salter, W. T., Merchant, A. M., Gilbert, M. E., Buckley, T. N. PARbars: Cheap, Easy to Build Ceptometers for Continuous Measurement of Light Interception in Plant Canopies. J. Vis. Exp. (147), e59447, doi:10.3791/59447 (2019).), developed a measurement system and ceptometers for capturing information on light within crop canopy. Replace unavailable components with suitable alternatives. Built and calibrated the equipment. The equipment showed strong agreement with a known-good, calibrated sensor. The equipment was deployed in-field and obtained data at a significantly lower cost than commercially available solutions. <br>University of Arizona, Maricopa, Arizona, USA<br/><img src='/images/2021Ceptometer.jpg'>"
